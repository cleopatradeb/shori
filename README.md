> *Bringing together venues and budding artists. A win-win situation.*
> Shori is Japanese for "win", pointing to the underlying philosophy of the app - to create a win-win situation: for budding artists looking to showcase their art, and venues looking for free decor and diversifying their products risk-free.

> **NOTE** 
> Shori was my final project of WDI at GA London. This project is still in production but the following code snippets may come in handy for reference. I have categorized them via **main functionality** and **front-end highlights**. Please feel free to reference them!
